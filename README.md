#FACE RECOGNITION 

Face (facial) recognition is the identification of humans by the unique characteristics of their Faces. Face recognition technology is the least intrusive and fastest bio-metric technology. It works with the most obvious individual identifier of the human face. With increasing security needs and with advancement in technology extracting information has become much simpler. This system based on face recognition using different algorithms and comparing the results. The basic purpose being to identify the face and retrieving information stored in database. It involves two main steps. First to identify the distinguishing factors in image and storing them and Second step to compare it with the existing images and returning the data related to that image. The various algorithms used for face detection are PCAAlgorithm and Gray Scale Algorithm etc.
